1/22/2017 - Created Repo, formatlinks.pig, FormatLinks UDF - Adit
	//formatlinks.pig currently outputs in correct format, still need to update
	//so that it outputs to HBase instead of HDFS. The other folder is the UDF
	//file I used, we could get around the UDF, but it seems to be more hassle
	//than its worth.
